<!-- SPHINX-START -->

This provides a versioned copy of SchemaStore for [validate-pyproject][]. You
can pin this to get a stable set of schema files.

## Usage

The following should be supported:

### Installing alongside validate-pyproject

Just use `pip install validate-pyproject-schema-store` wherever you have
`validate-pyproject[all]` installed. You can "inject" it if using pipx, or use
`--pip-args` if using `pipx run`.

In pre-commit, this would be:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/abravalheri/validate-pyproject
    rev: <insert here>
    hooks:
      - id: validate-pyproject
        additional_dependencies: [validate-pyproject[all], validate-pyproject-schema-store]
```

### Direct usage

For pre-commit or pipx, you can simplify this a bit by using this package
directly. That looks like this:

```bash
pipx run validate-pyproject-schema-store[all]
```

Or for pre-commit:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/henryiii/validate-pyproject-schema-store
    rev: <insert here>
    hooks:
      - id: validate-pyproject
```

This also has the benefit that the version will be pinned and updated by
pre-commit automatically.

## Developing

This project uses `hatch`. You can run the sync script on Python 3.11+ by
running:

```bash
hatch run sync
```
